<h1>
VENV Virtual Environment
</h1>

I recommend installing the virtual environment. Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in development and in production, also have specific PATH variables for program.

> mkdir myproject
> cd myproject
> py -3 -m venv venv

> venv\Scripts\activate

type 'deactivate' to disable
>deactivate
